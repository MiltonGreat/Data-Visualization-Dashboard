# Data Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my data visualization portfolio! In this repository, you will find examples of my work in creating insightful and interactive dashboards using four different tools: Microsoft Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Python. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze, transform, and visualize data in a meaningful way. Below are links to each of the individual dashboards.

### Key Skills & Techniques

1. Data Cleaning: I clean raw data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
2. Data Analysis: I perform descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and correlation studies.
3. Data Transformation: I use techniques like data aggregation, pivoting, and categorization to make data ready for visualization.
4. Interactive Dashboards: I create dashboards that provide insights using various filters, slicers, and drilldowns.
5. Data Storytelling: I design dashboards that not only visualize data but also tell a compelling story with key insights.
