# Data Visualization Dashboards in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau

In this repository, you will find examples of my work in creating insightful and interactive dashboards using four different tools: Microsoft Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Python. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze, transform, and visualize data in a meaningful way. Below are links to each of the individual dashboards.

### Dataset

The Healthcare Employee Attrition Dataset, while synthetic, is modeled after real-world data and has been tailored to reflect the unique environment of the healthcare sector. The dataset also includes various employee characteristics and job details that are critical for identifying patterns in employee behavior.

Here are some of the key columns present in this dataset:

- EmployeeID: A unique identifier for each employee.
- Age: The age of the employee.
- Attrition: Whether the employee has left the company (1) or stayed (0). This is a binary column (Yes/No).
- BusinessTravel: The frequency of business travel (e.g., “Travel_Rarely”, “Travel_Frequently”, “Non-Travel”).
- DailyRate: The daily rate of pay for the employee.
- Department: The department to which the employee belongs (e.g., “Cardiology”, “Maternity”, “Neurology”).
- DistanceFromHome: The distance (in miles) between the employee’s home and the office.
- Education: The employee’s level of education (e.g., “1” might indicate a high school diploma, “2” might indicate a bachelor’s degree, etc.).
- EducationField: The field of study or specialization (e.g., “Life Sciences”, “Medical”, “Other”).
- Gender: The gender of the employee (e.g., “Male”, “Female”).
- JobRole: The employee’s job role (e.g., “Nurse”, “Therapist”, “Administrative”).
- JobSatisfaction: A measure of the employee’s job satisfaction (on a scale of 1-4).
- MaritalStatus: The marital status of the employee (e.g., “Married”, “Single”).
- MonthlyIncome: The monthly income of the employee.
- OverTime: Whether the employee works overtime (Yes/No).
- PerformanceRating: A score representing the employee’s performance.
- RelationshipSatisfaction: The employee’s satisfaction with their relationship with colleagues (on a scale of 1-4).
- TotalWorkingYears: The total number of years the employee has worked (in all jobs).
- WorkLifeBalance: The employee’s work-life balance rating (on a scale of 1-4).
- YearsAtCompany: The number of years the employee has been with the current company.
- YearsInCurrentRole: The number of years the employee has spent in their current job role.

### Key Skills & Techniques

1. Data Cleaning: I clean raw data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
2. Data Analysis: I perform descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and correlation studies.
3. Data Transformation: I use techniques like data aggregation, pivoting, and categorization to make data ready for visualization.
4. Interactive Dashboards: I create dashboards that provide insights using various filters, slicers, and drilldowns.
5. Data Storytelling: I design dashboards that not only visualize data but also tell a compelling story with key insights.
